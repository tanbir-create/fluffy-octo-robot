    description: 'Deepak Kumar Jain is the founder of Deepak Astro Vaastu. Hes been practicing since 2004. He started teaching these divine sciences in 2008 and has educated more than 500 students and the journey continues. He also practiced and mastered the Prashan Shastra. Gradually he experienced that we can only improve the things and empower our karmas. If we focus on our karma and take the help of astrology, vaastu and other divine sciences, we can get good results. So he started analysing the horoscope to its purpose, know-yourself with the help of Astrology. People feel happy when they know the Purpose of their Life. He then researched on Lal kitab and Vaastu Remedies. During this research he found that even we can get the help of Ayurveda and Yoga as a Remedial Part and it works well. He works like a scientist, have logic of his every remedy and prediction. He works on patients suffering from chronic diseases and helps them to cure rapidly.'
